Expanded description including how much time was spent on task.

### 2024-01-03
Wrote `PROPOSAL.md`. Spent about 40 minutes.

Wrote `get_file_listing()`. Spent about 30 minutes including debugging.

### 2024-01-05
Fixed the `display_dir()` function and optimized to make the code shorter. The function was also skipping directories within the given directory, so I fixed that as well. This took around 15 minutes.

Created `process.h` file with functions necessary to open child processes and decide which program to run for some selected file in the file manager. Fixed an include guard inconsistency.
